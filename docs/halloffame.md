## Academic Year 2022-2023

### Project: **Tyrants of the Underdark**

**Description:**
*Tyrants of the Underdark* is a competitive game for 2-4 players that immerses you in the stories of Dungeons and Dragons. Who will be able to control the depths of the Underdark?.

To achieve this, we have four of the most important clans in the region. Each player will represent one of these clans, with the goal of creating the most optimal deck to become more efficient during their turn and take control of the map. There will be a common market from which everyone can buy cards using influence points. Be the first to get the best ones. Use power points to perform basic actions. Trade 1 power to deploy a troop, 3 to return an enemy spy, and 3 to eliminate an enemy troop.

Each card contains between 1 and several of the following actions:

- Resource action (actions that grant resources during your turn. For example: gain +2 Influence, gain +1 Power) 
- Immediate action (actions that produce an immediate effect when played. For example: assassinate 1 troop, replace a white troop) 
- End-of-turn actions (actions that are resolved at the end of the active player's turn. For example: at the end of the turn, promote a card played) 
- Complex actions (a complex action consists of several of the aforementioned actions or even multiple complex ones. We have 3 types: CHOOSE (choose one of several options), THEN (if you perform the first action, you can then do the second), and ALL (play all the actions)).

![chrome_JdTExQ9RLL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ff5f3a8-59a5-472e-ae84-47983c403922)

Control cities to earn victory points. Conquer capitals to gain resources and additional victory points during the course of the rounds.

Spies play a key role in players' strategies. Launch raids in areas of the map that your troops can never reach. Your troops will have presence in the location where they are and in adjacent areas, allowing you to deploy troops or assassinate enemy troops, among other things. However, spies can be deployed anywhere on the map (except on roads — only in cities), and they will only grant you presence in that specific city, not in adjacent ones.

![chrome_pB8GgKAAf7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6d6d40-f994-4660-8075-16f51b6284c7)

Play your cards in the most optimal way, create your own strategy, buy the best cards to carry out your plan, control as many locations as possible, and don’t let anyone stand in your way. Don't forget about your inner circle, promote cards to gain a greater victory point bonus during the final card count at the end of the game.

![chrome_ITvkcrv93d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf09404-d623-4350-86f6-f2dae82bdd08)

The endgame conditions are one of the following: all of a player's troops have been deployed (40 troops) or the market deck has been depleted. Once one of these conditions is met, the game round will finish, ensuring that all players have taken the same number of turns, and then victory points will be counted. You can earn victory points in the following ways:

- VP value of each location you control
- 2 VP for each location under total control
- 1 VP for each troop in your trophy hall (assassinated enemy troops)
- VP value of each card in your deck, hand, and discard pile
- VP value of cards in your inner circle (promoted cards)
- VP tokens obtained during the game

The player with the most victory points will be the winner, and thus, the clan with the most power in the Underdark. Will you be able to face the risks that come with it, or will you fall into the darkness of the depths?
